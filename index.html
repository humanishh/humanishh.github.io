    I'm Himanshu Bhisikar (pronounced he-mahn-shu), a postgraduate researcher at the <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/">Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA), 
    Bengaluru</a>. I am currently working with <a href="https://www.iiap.res.in/?q=smithasubramanian">Dr. Smitha Subramanian</a> wherein we are investigating the 
    presence of Relic galaxies in the local universe using multi-wavelength (SDSS+GALEX) photometric and spectroscopic techniques. Prior to joining IIA, I had 
    graduated from the <a href="https://www.iiserpune.in/">Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER)-Pune</a>, with an Integrated Bachelor's and 
    Master's in Science, with a major in physics and a minor in biology. My MS Thesis was done under the supervision of <a href="https://web.iucaa.in/~kanak/">
    Dr. Kanak Saha</a>, wherein we studied the properties of the star-forming regions in the nearby Virgo Cluster galaxy NGC 4571. <br> <br>
    The objects I am most fascinated by are <strong>Galaxies</strong>, as they are the building blocks of the universe. There is a wide range of variation 
    observed in their morphologies, evolution pathways, inner structure, components, gas and dust distribution, stellar populations properties, the whole lot.
     Studying them will give us insights into the history and evolution of our universe.
