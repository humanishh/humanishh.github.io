<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> I was born in Nagpur, the winter capital of Maharashtra, also aptly known as 'The Orange city' and 'The Tiger capital' of India. However, I've had the oportunity of a lifetime of having lived in various cities all across india (Kolkata, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Bengaluru along with Nagpur), which gave me a wide perspective of life that is, and the ability to connect with the incredible diversity of the people, the culture and the traditions of India. </span>

<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> Since I was a kid, I have been fascinated and mesmerized by the heavens and the heavenly bodies. There was something so mysterious, so alluring to look at the the big orange sun in the wee hours of the morning and the twinkling stars and the white moon at night. This curiosity was then supplemented by a serious urge to study the heavens in a serious and scientific manner. The turning points in my life came when I was in my 4th grade. It was the time India launched its first mission to the moon: <a href="https://www.isro.gov.in/Chandrayaan_1.html"> Chandrayaan-1 </a>. I remember drawing the specific trajectories it would follow on its way to the moon. It was also around this time that I first read about the Indo-American astronauts who inspired an entire generation of young minds (yours truly included) to dream big and work hard: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalpana_Chawla"> Kalpana Chawla </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunita_Williams"> Sunita Williams </a>. It was then that tender age of 10 that I decided to set about to become an astrophysicist, and well, here we are. </span>
