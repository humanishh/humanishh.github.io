<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> When I am not invading the privacy of galaxies, I can be found spending my time doing the following : </span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> 1. **Youtube :** I try to enrich my knowledge on a large variety of topics, ranging from memes to political debates to religious discourses to defense (you name it, I've got it). </span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> 2. **Music :** I consider music to be an inseperable part of me. Having been trained in the Hindustani and Carnatic music styles throughout my school life, I have always felt connected to it. I play the keyboards and have participated in a lot of programmes for various institutions. I also aspire to learn to play a lot of other Western and Indian instruments. </span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> 3. **Reading :** I read fictional and non-fictional books, news articles, tech articles, blogs, tweets, posts, the whole lot. I even read the user manuals of new gadgets purchased :). I see reading as the most primal way of satisfying my curiosity of any and all topics. </span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> 4. **Outdoor sports :** I enjoy playing and watching cricket, badminton and football. </span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> 5. **Motorsports :** I am an avid fan of motorsports such as F1 and WRC. I make it a point to catch up every race on sundays. The sight of 20 drivers using all their physical and mental strength, along with constant and intelligent communication by the pit wall really does push your adrenaline over the moon. </span> <br>
<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> 6. **Politics :** Politics is perhaps the only thing that affects every citizen in a country. It is therefore important to be abreast of the developments in one's nation, the plans and ambitions of the government, and to critically analyze their schemes in order to move ahead as a society. I make it a point to stay aware of the day-to-day workings of the elected government, whilst also keeping tabs on the economical and geopolitical growth. </span> <br>
