<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> Star formation is one of the key principal agents governing the formation and evolution of galaxies. It encompasses the origins of stars and planetary systems, and is therefore a subject at the roots of astrophysics at the largest scales. In my work done in collaboration with [Prof. Kanak Saha](https://web.iucaa.in/~kanak/) at the Inter-University center for Astronomy and Astrophysicd (IUCAA), we present an in-depth investigation of the star forming properties of the nearby virgo cluster galaxy **NGC 4571**. We use multi-wavelength data taken from the Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT), Sloan DIgital Sky Survey (SDSS), Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) instruments. We carry out a detection of the star-forming clumps (SFCs) preent throughout the galaxy and derived their basic astrophysical properties such as size, radial distance, color, age, mass. With the suprtior spatial resolution of UVIT, we identified 400 such SFCs in the FUV and NUV bands, with ~50% of the identified SFCs found to be younger than 200 Myr. This points towards a recent enhancement of star-formation activity throughout the galaxy. The younger SFCS were found to distinctly trace the flocculent arms of the galaxy. We also present a detailed study of the Giant Molecular Clouds (GMCs) present in the galaxy, along with their associations with the nearby-found SFCs. More details can be found in this paper. </span>

<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"> Red nuggets are a type of compact and massive galaxies found in the high (z ~ 1.5-2.0) redshift universe. These galaxies are usually considered to be the progenitors of the present-day massive and large ellipticals found in the local universe. Such galaxies are often formed by building their 3D envelopes through gas-poor minor mergers. Studies also suggest that some fraction of red nuggets can build 2D disks around them by accreting gas-rich smaller galaxies and consequently become present-day massive early-type spiral galaxies. Due to the stochastic nature of mergers, it is also predicted that some of them could have remained undisturbed till the present day. A study of local analogs of high-z red nuggets will provide important insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies at high redshift. In my work done in collaboration with [Prof. Smitha Subramanian](https://www.iiap.res.in/?q=smithasubramanian), we present a list of candidate relic galaxies in the local universe using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We present their stellar properties taken from the GSWLC and MPAJHU catalogs. We also present a study on the stellar population properties of these galaxies by performing spectral analysis of the SDSS spectra of these galaxies using FIREFLY. We found a total of 973 candidate galaxies, which were further narrowed down to 45 galaxies which could be our most-probable red nuggets. More details can be found in this paper. </span>
